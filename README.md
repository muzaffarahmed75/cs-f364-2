# Brief description

### Overview
This project implements the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow in directed graphs.  
It also implements a solution to the Maximum Bipartite Matching problem by converting it to a maximum flow problem.

### Input and running
Build and run by using the command ```./run.sh <input_files>```  
The input must be ```.txt``` files and must represent the graph by an edge-list.  
Sample input has been included in ```data/```.
Execute ```./run.sh data/*``` to run the program on all sample files.  
Any metadata may be present in lines prepended by a # in the input files.  
All output will be generated in ```output/```.
